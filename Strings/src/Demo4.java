	 * ### **Important Features of the String Class**
	 * 
	 * 1. **String Constant Pool (SCP):** - It is a special memory location in the
	 * heap area that stores string literals.
	 * 
	 * 2. **Immutable Objects:** - String objects are immutable, meaning once a
	 * string object is created, its data or state cannot be changed. Instead, a new
	 * string object is created.
	 * 
	 * 3. **`+` Operator for Strings:** - Multiple strings can be concatenated using
	 * the `+` operator.
	 * 
	 * 4. **Security:** - Strings are widely used for network connections, database
	 * connection URLs, usernames, passwords, etc. If strings were mutable, these
	 * parameters could be altered easily, leading to security vulnerabilities.
	 * 
	 * 5. **Class Loading:** - Strings are used as arguments for class loading. If
	 * strings were mutable, it could result in loading the wrong class since
	 * mutable objects can change their state.
	 * 
	 * 6. **Synchronization and Concurrency:** - Since strings are immutable, they
	 * are inherently thread-safe, eliminating synchronization issues in
	 * multi-threaded environments.
	 * 
	 * 7. **Memory Management:** - The compiler optimizes string objects by storing
	 * identical string literals in the **String Constant Pool (SCP)**. If two
	 * variables reference the same literal, only one string object is used,
	 * reducing memory usage.

	 * ### **Why is the String class final in Java?**
	 * 
	 * The **String** class has several special features that are not available in
	 * other Java classes. Making the **String** class **final** prevents
	 * sub classing, which could otherwise break these assumptions and lead to
	 * security vulnerabilities.

	 * 
	 * ---
	 * 
	 * The `final` keyword is used with **classes, methods, and variables**, but
	 * **immutability** is a concept related to objects, where an object's state and
	 * content cannot be changed after creation.
	 * 
	 * Would you like me to expand on this explanation with examples? ðŸ˜Š
