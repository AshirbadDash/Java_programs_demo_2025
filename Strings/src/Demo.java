	 * @implNote1- String is non-primitive data-types.
	 * 
	 *             {@value2}-String is the sequence of characters.(Array of
	 *             characters)
	 * 
	 *             example :char[] c={'h','e','l','l','o'};//charSequence
	 *             Interface(to represent character sequence)
	 * 
	 *             String s=new String(C);
	 * 
	 *             -->String is a class
	 * 
	 *             public final class String extends Object implements
	 *             CharSequence,Serializable,Comparable(object is the parent class
	 *             of all the classes in java)
	 * 
	 *             {
	 * 
	 *             }why string class is final.
	 * 
	 * 
	 *             -->Serializable interface is used when we need to store a copy of
	 *             the object send them to another process which runs on the same
	 *             system or over the network.
	 * 
	 * 
	 *             -->comparable interface is used to order the objects of the class
	 *             it has only one method compareTo()
	 * 
	 *             -->String is an immutable object
	 * 
	 *             -->String s=new String();//creating string class object
	 * 
	 *             -->the object created will be an immutable object
	 * 
	 *             -->String s1="java";//string constant pool
	 * 
	 * 
	 *             -->To create String there are three classes; and 4 ways
	 * 
	 *             -String
	 * 
	 *             -StringBuffer -StringBuilder
